This is a blog to write my development and learning journey exploring the world of technology. I will write about my projects, my thoughts, and my learning process here. Please excuse my grammar mistakes, as I am not a native English speaker.

Also, please note that I'm not a professional developer, I'm just a student who loves to code and learn new things. I'm still learning and I'm open to any feedback or suggestions. If you have any questions or just want to chat, feel free to reach out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/reverseproxie).
